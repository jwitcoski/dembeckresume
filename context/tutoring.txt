Tutoring Approach

Assessment-Based Planning
All tutoring begins with a comprehensive assessment of the student's current skills, learning profile, and specific needs. This assessment informs the development of individualized learning goals and instructional plans.

Evidence-Based Methods
I utilize only research-supported instructional approaches and interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness for students with similar learning needs. Methods are selected based on each student's specific profile and learning goals.

Progress Monitoring
Regular progress monitoring is integrated into all tutoring services to ensure that interventions are effective and to make timely adjustments when needed. Data collection methods are aligned with learning goals and provide clear evidence of growth.

Collaboration with Schools and Families
I work closely with classroom teachers, school-based specialists, and families to ensure consistency across learning environments. Regular communication ensures that tutoring supports and complements school-based instruction.

Focus on Independence
All tutoring services aim to develop students' independence and self-efficacy. Instruction includes explicit attention to metacognitive strategies, self-monitoring techniques, and gradual release of responsibility.
