New Program Development

Special Education Undergraduate Program (2022-Present)
Led the development of a new 30 credit program for undergraduate teachers to gain certification in special education. The program focuses on evidence-based practices, inclusive education, and technology integration for students with disabilities. 

Literacy Tutoring Program for Foster Youth (2019-2024)
Established a collaborative program between Brooklyn College and the New York Foundling to provide evidence-based literacy tutoring for youth in foster care. The program served as both a service initiative and a research site, providing valuable learning experiences for tutors while supporting a vulnerable student population.
